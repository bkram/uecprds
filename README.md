# uecprds

A lightweight Python class for sending simple UECP RDS commands over a serial connection.

Created by reverse-engineering the serial communication of the **"EP-RDS v1.2"** Windows tool by *Klabautermann*.

Tested with the **Profline SFM RDS** built-in encoder, but it should also work with other RDS encoders that conform to the UECP protocol.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Configure RDS parameters like **PI**, **PS**, **Radiotext**, **PTY**, **TP**, **TA**, and **MS** flags.
- Build and send properly framed **UECP messages**.
- Includes **byte-stuffing** and **CRC-16-CCITT checksum**.
- Simple and readable **serial communication**.
- Suitable for **automation** and **command-line integration**.

## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **`pyserial` library**

To install the required library on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-serial
```

---

## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bkram/uecprds.git
cd uecprds
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Modify the `example.py` file if needed to customize the RDS parameters.
2. Run the example script:

```bash
python3 example.py
```

## üìñ Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure and send RDS frames:

```python
from uecprds import UECPRDS

# Create UECPRDS instance
rds = UECPRDS(
    port="/dev/ttyUSB0",
    baudrate=9600,
    delay=2.0,
    pi=0x1234,
    ps="ITALO FM",
    rt="Now playing: Italo Disco Hits",
    pty=10,
    ms=True,
    tp=False,
    ta=False,
)

# Send all RDS frames to the serial device
rds.send_all()
```
